                        In Plaxicaneria, the campaign aims to raise awareness of the harmful effects of using single-use plastics on our ecosystem and the environment. Our 
             addiction to plastic also has negative effects on the environment. A new report showed that plastic creation adds to planet-warming ozone harming substance 
                emanations at each point in its life cycle. The way toward penetrating for plastic's source materials, oil and gas, prompts methane spilling and erupting and
                 is frequently joined with clearing woodlands and wetlands that in any case would have sequestered carbon. Treatment facilities where raw petroleum is 
                 transformed into plastic make up perhaps the most ozone-harming substance concentrated businesses in the assembling area.
